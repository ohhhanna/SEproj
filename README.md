# SEproj
Project implementing my event management system
This was part of my semester laboratory curriculum 
we followed a classical waterfall system from start to finish to come up with the project
we started with making the SRS 
drew DFD and other object oriented models to identify how to build the software better
then finally made the frontend of the project following the step by step working written in the SRS


this gave me a strong idea of how a software is built
